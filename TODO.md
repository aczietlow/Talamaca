What to track for "contributions"
- [ ] Opening issues
- [ ] participating in issue/discussions 
- [ ] code contributions
  - Match the tracking that GitHub provides
    - Commits: The most straightforward measure of contribution is through commits. GitHub tracks the number of commits a user makes to a repository. This includes contributions to the project's codebase and documentation. 
    - Pull Requests: GitHub tracks both the creation of pull requests and contributions to others' pull requests. This includes not only the initial submission but also any subsequent commits made in response to feedback. 
    - Issue Reporting: Opening new issues is counted as a contribution. Issues are essential for tracking bugs, requesting new features, or discussing potential changes in the project. 
    - Code Reviews: Participating in the code review process is also considered a contribution. This includes commenting on, approving, or requesting changes on pull requests.
