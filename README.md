## Getting Started

Create a config.json using the contents of config.default.json as a template.

Read permissions are permissible without an access token, however write permissions will require token access. To create a token perform the following steps:

1. Create a Personal Access Token
- Go to your GitHub account settings.
- Navigate to "Developer settings" > "Personal access tokens".
- Click on "Generate new token".
- Select the scopes or permissions you'd like the token to have and generate the token.
- Copy the generated token. Make sure to save it securely as it's shown only once.
2. Using the Token in Your Code:
- Add your token to the config.json file.
